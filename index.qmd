title: "An example Quarto project using Netlify's build plugin"
---

This is a minimal Quarto website built using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)'s build plugin.

## Computational content

This project uses Quarto's [freeze capabilities](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze), and has the `_freeze` directory under version control. 
This way, computational content is not executed in CI.

### Example: Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
